#CoffeEncyclopedia

## Description

Welcome to the the CoffeEncyclopedia.

A website designed to help to help you de-mystify the different kind of coffee drinks there are out there.

This is part of a project studying React and API implementation.

Specifically about the API found here: https://sampleapis.com/api-list/coffee

## Technologies Used

ReactJS, Bootstrap 

## Challenges

The hardest part of this assignment for me was trying to deploy the website as up til now, I still don't know how to deploy it.
Barring that, the most difficult part was keeping up with prop passing. There would be too many times where I would think that a function is available.
only for it to be something I completely forgot to add in.

## Favorite Part

My favorite part of the assignment was working with Bootstrap, it gave me a new interesting look at CSS and I'm excited to use it more in the future.

## Plans for the future

Definitely looking to develop my skills in bootstrap to make the website look better and looking to differentiate between drinks that you want to try and ones you know you like in your favorites list. Maybe add different kind of drinks.
